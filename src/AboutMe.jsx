        My name is Idi Ameen. I'm a recent graduate of General Assembly, where I
        gained my knowledge of Full Stack Web Development. I learned how to use
        different programming languages, such as JavaScript, React, Express, and
        Ruby on Rails. At General Assembly, I was challenged with several
        projects, where I showcased what I learned during instruction.I
        continued on my eduction, and strengthed my skillset by completed the
        UX/UI design course on Udemy. Working on several web applications not
